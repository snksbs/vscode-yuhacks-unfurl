# Unfurl

## 💡 Inspiration

Sometimes you have to write a lot of code to get a piece of the project done. ANd completing the task before the given deadline makes it hard to read and understand. Therefore, we created a VS Code extension that will help you with providing a snipped code which can save a lot of time. Along with this it also allows users to create custom functions and abbreviations.

## 💻 What it does

Unfurl is a VS Code extension that helps you with providing the snippet of code you are looking for, custom functions for your language, and abbreviation for your language. The VS Code extension can be useful for anyone who is looking for a code snippet or a function or abbreviation to use in their code and stay focused on the code. Unfurl is easy to use, and efficient.
